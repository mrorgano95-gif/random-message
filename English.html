        It is proven that a good education will improve children's prospects, and open doors that might otherwise be closed. It will increase their chance of finding a good job, and with it the likelihood of more money and higher status. But a good education should be more than that. It should help children to develop self-esteem and self-awareness. It should teach them to take responsibility for the world they inhabit, so they understand why they vote in elections, why freedom of speech is important, why preventive health care matters, etc.<br><br>

        Education should also help children to unlock their innate capacity to be creative. Finally, it should teach them to have respect for other human beings and give them a sense of morality.

        In the UK, there is a continuing debate about many issues regarding the education of our children. For example:<br><br>

        • At the age of two or three, is a child better off in a nursery school with other children, or at home with their mother or childminder?<br><br>

        • Are independent schools divisive and elitist, or do parents have the right to send their children to fee-paying private schools with smaller class sizes, and statistically a much higher chance of getting into university?<br><br>

        • There is some evidence that girls do well in single-sex schools where they are not being distracted by boys. If that is true, are co-educational schools still better than single-sex schools?<br><br>

        • Should religion be a compulsory subject on the curriculum? And if so, what should we be teaching?<br><br>

        Here are some tips for exam revision.<br><br>

        • The first step is to draw up a revision schedule. Be realistic. You can't revise all the time.<br><br>

        • Consider how long you can concentrate at any one time. There's no point in sitting in front of your notes for hours if you're not absorbing anything. It is probably wiser to revise in short bursts.<br><br>

        • Taking short breaks in your revision periods can be really beneficial. For one thing, it allows time for ideas and information to sink in.<br><br>

        • There won't be enough time to do everything, so prioritize your revision. Which topics are bound to come up and therefore essential to revise?<br><br>

        • When you've come up with a timetable, it's important to realize that things will not always go according to plan. Be ready to reorganize your schedule and your priorities to make sure you stay on track.
